>>> How will you remove last object from a list?
Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?

Lists are one of the mutable data types in python.These are ordered collection 
of different data types. For example,

my_list=[1, â€œone" ,1.4]
	
As lists are ordered collection of different data types, we can traverse through 
different elements in a list through the process of indexing. There are two types of indexing i. e positive indexing and negative indexing.Positive indexing starts from the first 	element of the list itself (i. e from extreme left corner) while negative indexing starts in reverse order i. e from the last 	element of the list. Here,

list1=[2,33 222,14,25]

Thus here,

list1[-1]=25

list1[-2]=14

list1[2]=222
